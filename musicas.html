      Sweet Child O' Mine
<br>
<br>


She's got a smile that it seems to me <br>
Reminds me of childhood memories <br>
Where everything was as fresh<br>
As the bright blue sky<br>
<br>
Now and then when I see her face<br>
She takes me away to that special place<br>
And if I stare too long<br>
I'd probably break down and cry<br>

Oh, oh, oh, sweet child of mine<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet love of mine<br>
<br>
She's got eyes of the bluest skies<br>
As if they thought of rain<br>
I hate to look into those eyes<br>
And see an ounce of pain<br>
<br>
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place<br>
Where, as a child, I'd hide<br>
And pray for the thunder and the rain<br>
To quietly pass me by<br>
<br>
Oh, oh, oh, sweet child of mine<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet love of mine<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet child of mine<br>
Ooh, yeah, yeah<br>
Ooh! Sweet love of mine<br>

 <p>Welcome to the jungle
  <br>
  <br>

  
  Welcome to the jungle<br>
  We got fun and games<br>
  We got everything you want<br>
  Honey, we know the names<br>
  <br>
  We are the people that can find<br>
  Whatever you may need<br>
  If you got the money, honey<br>
  We got your disease<br>
  <br>
  In the jungle, welcome to the jungle<br>
  Watch it bring you to your knees, knees<br>
  Oh, I wanna watch you bleed<br>
  <br>
  Welcome to the jungle<br>
  We take it day by day<br>
  If you want it, you're gonna bleed<br>
  But it's the price you pay<br>
  <br>
  And you're a very sexy girl<br>
  That's very hard to please<br>
  You can taste the bright lights<br>
  But you won't get there for free<br>
  <br>
  In the jungle, welcome to the jungle<br>
  Feel my, my, my, my serpentine<br>
  I, I wanna hear you scream<br>
  <br>
  Welcome to the jungle<br>
  It gets worse here everyday<br>
  You learn to live like an animal<br>
  In the jungle, where we play<br>
  <br>
  If you got a hunger for what you see<br>
  You'll take it eventually<br>
  You can have anything you want<br>
  But you better not take it from me<br>
  <br>
  In the jungle, welcome to the jungle<br>
  Watch it bring you to your knees, knees<br>
  Oh, I wanna watch you bleed<br>
  <br>
  And when you're high, you never<br>
  Ever want to come down<br>
  So down, so down, so down, yeah<br>
  <br>
  You know where you are?<br>
  You're in the jungle, baby<br>
  You're gonna die<br>
  <br>
  In the jungle, welcome to the jungle<br>
  Watch it bring you to your knees, knees<br>
  In the jungle, welcome to the jungle<br>
  Feel my, my, my serpentine<br>
  <br>
  In the jungle, welcome to the jungle<br>
  Watch it bring you to your knees, knees<br>
  Down in the jungle, welcome to the jungle<br>
  Watch it bring you to you<br>
  It's gonna bring you down<br>

  [Scott Storch]<br>
  A nigga came from the bottom, down below<br>
  'Member them cold nights, I was sleepin' on the floor<br>
  Always dreamed about the Forgiato feet, now they down below<br>
  A nigga got so much money on me, I can't count no more<br>
  <br>
  'Member I was in the project walls, couldn't even get a loan<br>
  Now these niggas got they hands out, if I ain't give it, I'd bewrong<br> 
  'Member I was in the county jail none of these bitches wasn't pickin' up the phone<br> 
  Now they bangin' my line, I ain't got time no more<br> 
  <br> 
  A nigga started from the bottom, now I'm livin'<br> 
  Early morning, uncle whippin' in the kitchen<br> 
  Some people said I couldn't do it and then I did it<br> 
  Look at my bank account, I'm runnin' up the digits<br> 
  I ain't into all that "Doin'-that-facade" shit<br> 
  I walk it, I talk it, I live it<br> 
  <br> 
  Come to the bird house, look at the garage, nigga<br> 
  My Bentley coupe got a couple pigeons<br> 
  I was down on my ass, had to go a new direction<br> 
  Bought mom a Gucci purse, gave her 10 racks, told her you ain't gotta stress it<br> 
  It ain't even an emergency and a nigga 'bout to pull up in a 911<br> 
  Just to feed my dawgs, I told God it's a blessin' (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br> 
  <br> 
  A nigga came from the bottom, down below<br>

  Nigga came from the bottom, I had to make it out <br> 
  I was trappin' in the box, I had to break out <br> 
  Hurt my soul when the feds kicked down the vacant house <br> 
  Black truck on the corner, they had a stakeout <br> 
  Seen a dopeboy pullin' out a Wraith out <br> 
  <br> 
  Had to get up out the hood to the lake house <br> 
  The head chef 'bout to bring my steak out <br> 
  I was pourin' up the liters, swipin' them Visas <br> 
  They think a nigga Rondo 'cause I always kept a Nina <br> 
  Now my jewelry wetter than Aquafina, quick trip to Catalina <br> 
  White bitch bad as Selena, fuck her, then a nigga gotta leave <br> 
  <br> 
  I just wanna shine like the Wraith roof stars 'cause a nigga been down so long <br> 
  Ain't nobody see, bird vision, dawg, got it all on our own <br> 
  'Member them nights I was drivin', I was trappin' all night long <br> 
  Now I keep a shooter on the right <br> 
  Just in case a nigga try to do me wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) <br> 
  <br>
